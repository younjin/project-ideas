### Project Ideas

One of the wonderful things about having ADHD (and/or the attention span of a squirrel) is that ideas come hurtling towards you, seemingly out of nowhere. It is my hope that by forcing myself to write about them, I will:
- Remember them for longer than an hour or two, and
- Work on the ideas someday.

TL;DR: This is basically a glorified YASP (yet another side project) list.
