<!-- Being an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) ... -->
<!-- I declare that I am "retired" from hackathons from time to time. Why do I declare anything? -->

#### A Subset of the Constraints
- Literacy rates are low
- Lack of data/wifi
- Mobile phones `>` smartphones
- Language barrier
- Community Health Workers (CHWs) visit ~600 users/month
- Lack of education/awareness about health issues
- Lack of infrastructure/access to fast, dependable healthcare
- CHWs need training
- Babies are not being registered, which affects census data, planning future services, vaccination rates, etc.
- CHWs will have access to a tablet/smartphone, but connectivity is not guaranteed

<!-- #### Workarounds
- Stick to using simple phrases, emoji/pictures/pictographs, numbers rather than a text-heavy solution
- Use SMS/MMS over 
-->
