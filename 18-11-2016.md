### Favourite Beatles Album

In the event that I am stuck on a hypothetical deserted island and I am only allowed to take one Beatles album with me for company (I'm guessing the technology required to listen to it would be available?), 
it would be prudent to pick one with tracks that I already know I like. The trouble is, there are _many_ albums that have tracks that I like. Which album has the highest number of songs that I will enjoy?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_the_Beatles), the Beatles recorded **409** songs, where **237** were original compositions. 
Regardless of what the actual number of unique songs attributed to the Beatles are, I have a strict subset of those tracks that I would call a favourite. 
With this in mind, I wanted a way to actually determine what my "favourite Beatles album" was by the % of tracks that I consider a "favourite".

Ground rules to make this easier:
- A track that is recorded in the studio vs live are considered the "same song".
- The score for a given album will be calculated by `(# favourite tracks)/(# total tracks)`.
- Some fudge factor would have to account for the total number of favourite tracks.
- The definition of an album would probably be anything with `>=` a certain number of tracks.

I've always said that The White Album was my favourite; it'd be interesting to see if that is actually true!
